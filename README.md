# filmweb-scraping
I use beautifull soup library to get basics informations about movies from filmweb ranking.
Data on these site loads in a dynamic way, thats why i had to use selenium library to scroll down the page.
I find selenium usefull in hiding my "bot" indentity.
I have also purified downloaded data.
If you want to run code on your computer please remember to check if all the file paths are correct.
On my computer whole code runs in 155 seconds. Long time.. but it allows the "bot" to remain undedected.
Currently I am working on creating searching system, as a result of search with particular movie title, you will recive all info and chart (all based on gathered data :).
